Introduction
============
You probably have heard about Redux in some kind of JS context already. Some years ago Redux + React was all the hype in JS land. In that time, I first started working as a software engineer using python and creating apps for embedded Linux devices.

Having little experience I was always a little envious about the tools the frontend and backend developers had in their frameworks (namely Ruby on Rails and Redux + React).
It seemed like for them there always was a framework which told you where to put stuff and how to do things, while I had now idea how to translate those high level patterns into a small application that would parse some messages from a serial, or get some events and then do some IO with the data.
